### Test Data
Create test cases for:
- Various memory sizes (small, medium, large)
- Different process size distributions
- Edge cases (empty input, single process)
- Stress tests (many small processes)

### Example Test Case
```c
// Test First Fit with known input
void test_first_fit_basic() {
    MemoryManager manager;
    initialize_memory_manager(&manager, FIRST_FIT);
    
    Process p1 = {1, 100, PROCESS_NEW, -1};
    assert(allocate_memory(&manager, &p1) == true);
    assert(p1.state == PROCESS_RUNNING);
}
```
